Command used on the client side to generate reports:

cat ../iperf | parallel sudo iperf -c {} -e -t 30 |& tee report-{n}.txt

On the server side I ran iperf with in server mode with the following command

sudo iperf -s -D

And then I took the PID of the process and I assigned a taskset to avoid it will be executed on core 1, where the firewall is executed.

sudo taskset -cp 2-13 {IPERF_PID}

Finally, I set the interrupts for the ingress NIC to core #1
